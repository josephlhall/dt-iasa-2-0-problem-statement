--- abstract

This is a problem statement for the IETF IASA 2.0 work.  While other
drafts -- {{I-D.daigle-iasa-retrospective}},
{{I-D.hall-iasa20-workshops-report}}, {{I-D.arkko-ietf-iasa-thoughts}}
and {{I-D.arkko-ietf-finance-thoughts}} -- have at length described
potential problems that restructuring of the IETF administrative
support could solve, this draft aims to articulate a crisp, concrete
statement of the essential problem areas in order to seek rough
consensus on the problem itself.  The Design Team (the authors here)
hope that this problem statement provides a constructive focus for
further development of our recommendations for possible restructuring
options {{I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs}}.
